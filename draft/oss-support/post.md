# OSS Support

Free software. It's not _really_ free. Time, effort, innovation and labor go
into developing the open source projects that we use and sometimes can't live
without. A lot of these projects live in the background, known only to those
that dig into the low level building blocks of the net or in the lower depths
of the application layer of open and closed operating systems (see the EULA of
OSX and you'll see open source projects listed). Many open source projects find
funding through sales of support, licenses, and by hosting. But quite a few are
just put out there and sometimes they find there way into the tool boxes of
devs and designers, to the point where they almost become ubiquitous.

When you think about it, how many of the open source projects that you use all
the time are not heavily funded operations? VI, Emacs, heck even small tools
like sed to niche languages like tcl or lua. These are all entrenched and still
active. They may receive funding through the Free Software Foundation and
donations, but when was the last time you paid any money or gave anything back
to the developers of that editor, that library, that module that you always
turn too? 

## Inspiration

This topic was inspired by an event that occurred today, February 5 2015. The
_story_ of an open source project was showcased to the world. The showcase was
not made in a big way, I learned about it through a Slashdot RSS. But when
GnuPG curator, Werner Koch, published a blog post breaking down the costs of
maintaining that project the response was made in a big way. That blog post was
made back in December but the word seemed to get out today and in one day over
$200K in donations were pledged to keep the project alive. The largest
donations were made by the [Free Software Foundation's Core Infrastructure
Initiative][link_cii] ($60K), [Facebook][link_gnupg_fb] ($50K), and
[Stripe][link_stripe] ($50K).

## Concerns

GnuPG is only one example of backbone software projects that comprise the core
ecosystem that is the net. There are many others. A concerning notion is that
in a time when privacy concerns, brought about by government and overreaching
commercial entities, is the fact that many secure services are maintained by a
hand full of developers. These secure services are really at the front lines in
defending privacy on the net.  Awesome as these devs are, there is only so much
a few people can do. Bugs exists and no amount of coverage testing is going to
find them _all_.  Similarly, take for example the [HeartBleed][link_heartbleed]
event with OpenSSL. It surprised many to learn of the state that code base
was in and the lack of maintainers that library had. So much so that the
[OpenBSD decided to fork and refactor the project][link_openbsd]. 

**What are some other entrenched projects out there that are under funded/under
resourced? What are their stories?**

This leaves only one thing left to do... _I need to come up with an idea that
the community will pay me full time to code!_
